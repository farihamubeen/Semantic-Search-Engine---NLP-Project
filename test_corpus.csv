900-13-093-US-gaseous-nitrogen-safetygram-2 - Copy.pdf,"""Nitrogen makes up the major portion of the atmosphere (78.03% by volume, 75.5% by weight). Gaseous nitrogen is
 
inert, colorless, odorless, tasteless, nontoxic, noncorrosive, and non˜ammable. Nitrogen is inert and will not support 
combustion; however, it is not life supporting. 
Nitrogen is inert except when heated to very high temperatures, where it combines with some of the more active
 
metals, such as lithium and magnesium, to form nitrides. It will also combine with oxygen to form oxides of nitrogen 
and when combined with hydrogen in the presence of catalysts, will form ammonia. 
Since gaseous nitrogen is inert, special materials of construction are not normally required. Vessels and piping must 
be selected and designed to withstand the pressure and temperatures involved and comply with applicable codes and 
regulations. ",1
